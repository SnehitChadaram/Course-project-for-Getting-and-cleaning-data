# Course-project-for-Getting-and-cleaning-data

This is done as a part of the course project for Coursera 'Getting and Cleaning data'	<br />
It contains the runnable R script named 'run_analysis.R'<br />
To run it successfully, just make sure the folder in which the data is present is made available in the same directory as the runnable script. Also make sure you didn't edit the name of the folder<br />
<br />The script does the following:<br />
Take only the required data of the mean and standard deviation from the datasets<br />
Takes in all the other data given and outputs the desired dataset will full required content<br />
The extra variables are named properly<br />
The activity values are given the label names for each levels<br />
The required averages are calculated<br />
The final data is written to a text file as instructed<br />

Note: The code is commented of what it is doing depending on the sections of code
